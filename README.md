This is a simple Python program that allows us to automatically collect the top news headlines from a news website like BBC. It uses two popular Python libraries:

requests to fetch the website's content

BeautifulSoup to extract the headlines from the HTML

When we run the script, it reads the web page, grabs all the <h2> tags (where headlines are usually stored), and saves the text from those tags into a text file (headlines.txt).

This tool helps us quickly collect the latest news without opening the website manually. We can later read or process the headlines from the saved file.

The program is designed to be clean, easy to use, and a great introduction to web scraping using Python.
